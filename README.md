# Starry Night Interactive Painting
We propose making an interactive version of Van Gogh's Starry Night, which invites the user to blow on the painting, triggering LEDs behind the painting to blink in different patterns, resembling the movement of stars and wind. The bottom right of the painting includes a town with houses that will also have LEDs that turn on and off to mimic people moving about the town. 

## Summary
Here, write a few paragraphs (half a page?) or so describing the goals of your project.

Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

## Component Parts
From what pieces will you build your project? Will you build or buy those pieces?

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.
### Block Diagram

## Challenges
A brief discussion of what you anticipate will be the hardest and most time-consuming parts.

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal 
- Week 2: Purchase necessary sensors and LEDS and create a mockup of where we want all of the LEDs to be. 
- Week 3: Program sensors and finalize layout of LEDs
- Week 4: Print painting, create frame, assemble all components + time for any unexpected debugging
- Week 5: Present!
