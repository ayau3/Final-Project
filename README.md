# Starry Night Interactive Painting
We propose making an interactive version of Van Gogh's Starry Night, which invites the user to blow on the painting, triggering LEDs behind the painting to blink in different patterns, resembling the movement of stars and wind. The bottom right of the painting includes a town with houses that will also have LEDs that turn on and off to mimic people moving about the town. 

## Summary
Here, write a few paragraphs (half a page?) or so describing the goals of your project.

Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

## Component Parts
The Van Gogh painting will be printed on a large sheet of paper that will allow the light of the LEDs to diffuse through. Extra paper can be layered or cut out to allow different amounts of light through. 

Components:
Wooden frame and large sheet of semi-transparent paper to display painting
Sound sensor to detect user’s breath (INPUT)
LEDs, to resemble stars (OUTPUT)

## Challenges
A brief discussion of what you anticipate will be the hardest and most time-consuming parts.

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal 
- Week 2: Purchase necessary sensors and LEDS and create a mockup of where we want all of the LEDs to be. 
- Week 3: Program sensors and finalize layout of LEDs
- Week 4: Print painting, create frame, assemble all components + time for any unexpected debugging
- Week 5: Present!

  - “This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big,” wrote van Gogh to his brother Theo, describing his inspiration for one of his best-known paintings, The Starry Night (1889).

  - This connection gives a special significance to this van Gogh quote, "Looking at the stars always makes me dream. Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star."
